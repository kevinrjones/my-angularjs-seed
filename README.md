This is a seed application for Angular with Node/Express/Mongo

It provides a login screen with an authentication service which uses MongoDB as the data store

To try this out you need to install node, checkout this code and do an npm update. Install MongoDB, create a 'Seed' database with a 'users' collection.
You should then be able to browse to the logon page and register a user

The code contains the string '[S|s]eed' in various places, this is the stuff that needs to be changed to suit
